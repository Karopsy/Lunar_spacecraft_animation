# Lunar_spacecraft_animation
This Matlab code creates an animation of the Moon with all the known position of landing/crash of human launched spacecrafts since 1959.  

The list of the missions can be find there: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_artifact_impacts.html
The high definition of the lunar surface comes from https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/

1) This code has been written in order to visually assess how many missions to the Moon has been sent since the beginning of the lunar exploration.
2) It also includes a separated part with lines to save the video (with the details of the camera angles etc that the user can tune-up) 

If you have any questions/remarks, I would be happy to hear/answer them!
